	<h2>About</h2>

	<p>
		The IEEE Computer Society at The University of Texas at Austin works to connect students who are highly interested in the field of computer engineering with companies who can provide insight to this industry. We find it extremely important that students be exposed to real world engineering projects, and assisting them in this endeavour is an essential part of what we do.
